# 🛗 10th Floor Delivery Challenge

**Inspired by _Getting Over It_.**

---

## 📖 Story

One day, a chicken delivery guy arrives at an apartment building.  
He steps into the elevator to go to the 10th floor — but instead of regular buttons, there's... a keyboard.

> "What the heck is this?"

Turning around, he finds a notice:

> **Notice**  
> - This elevator uses keys instead of buttons.  
> - Three keys are assigned:  
>   - 1st floor  
>   - Move up  
>   - Move down  
> - **Important:** Due to technical issues, the keys are randomly assigned **on each floor**.  
> Thank you for your understanding.

(Unfortunately, the key assignment list has been torn off — thanks to the developer.)

Frustrated, the delivery guy decides to take the stairs...  
But an announcement immediately blares through the speakers:

> **"Attention: The stairs are currently under maintenance. Please use the elevator."**

Now screaming internally (and maybe externally), the delivery guy has no choice.

**Will he survive this cursed elevator and deliver the chicken?**
